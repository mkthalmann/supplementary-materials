## Abstract

We present the results of an experiment on presupposition projection out of the scope of the attitude
predicate *be certain*. Fox (2013) (building onGeorge 2010) maintains that a trivalent system based on
a Strong Kleene logic makes correct predictions for presupposition projection out of the scope of generalized quantifiers over entities. Consider the sentence in (1), where the presupposition triggerstopis
embedded underbe certain. If *be certain* behaves like a universal quantifier over possible worlds, and
quantification obeys the same logic across domains, Strong Kleene predicts that the truth conditions of
the sentence are as is spelled out below:

```
(1) Taro is certain that Aditi stopped drinking wine.
a. T if Taro is certain that Aditi used to drink wine and stopped.
b. F if Taro considers it possible that Aditi used to drink wine and didn't stop.
c. # if Taro is either certain that Aditi didn't use to drink wine, or if he is not certain whether
she used to drink wine, he is certain that if she used to, she has stopped.
```

For this experiment, we compare two hypotheses: the Strong Kleene hypothesis presented above and
a universal projection hypothesis, which is generally assumed for attitude predicates, for example in dynamic frameworks (Heim 1992): this alternative hypothesis requires embedded presuppositions to be
satisfied in every accessible world. We run a $4 \times 2$ trivalent truth value judgment task (cf. Križ & Chemla
2015 ), where one factor is the scenario (true vs. false vs. undefined vs. critical; with the first three
levels serving as controls) and the other manipulates matrix negation. Our design also includes presupposition trigger as a pseudo-factor (*stop* vs. *again*) to control for the effects of local accommodation.

In our critical scenario, the presupposition is satisfied existentially for a false sentence, as deemed sufficient in (1b). Participants' judgments for this scenario show an effect of matrix negation, on par with
the false scenario. By contrast, the undefined condition did not show sensitivity to negation and was
universally judged as neither completely true nor completely false. Therefore, our results do not support
the hypothesis that presuppositions project universally across the board out of the scope of *be certain*;
instead, the contrasts observed are better captured by the Strong Kleene hypothesis.
 
Finally, if local accommodation is an operator that collapses False and Undefined, as the $B$ operator
in Fox (2013) (after Beaver & Krahmer 2001), that can be freely inserted in the structure, we should
observe a contrast between *stop* and *again* when the presupposition is not met. Given that no contrast is
observed between the two presupposition triggers, our experiment does not offer evidence in support of
local accommodation for presuppositions in the scope of an attitude verb.
